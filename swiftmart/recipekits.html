		<p>For those taken by the hustling and bus- tling work culture of the city, SwiftMart serves as a quick stop shop for a sense of releif, com- fort and quality groceries! Designed with the the busy city dwellersâ€™ schedules in mind, Swift- Mart offers a wide variety of pre-packed meals as well as pre-packed dinner kits so the shop- ping is done for you! We also offer delivery!
		<br>The demographic being worked with here are in the lower Manhattan area. The median age range is roughly 30 and half of the population consists of single individu- als. There are not many household with chil- dren so this grocery store will cater mainly to young adults who are just entering the work- force while chasing their dreams.
		SwiftMart will offer everything other grocery stores offer while taking away the stress of choosing. A restricted variety model will be used for present products.
		Targeting a younger audience, the store will use a more modern approach. Dark gray- scale tones will be used for walls and shelves with bright lights over head while featuring yellowish colored wood to accent the area. Green will also be added in the form of plants to provide shoppers with a sense of comfort.</p>
